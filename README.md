The Snapshot Gallery Clone is a sleek, responsive image gallery crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
designed to showcase photos or project snapshots in a modern grid layout. It features an interactive
lightbox with navigation arrows and captions, subtle hover effects, and a clean, minimalistic aesthetic
that adapts seamlessly to any screen size. To set it up, simply clone the repository and open ime.html
in a browser; customize it by replacing placeholder images and captions in the HTML, tweaking styles in
ime.css, or enhancing functionality in ime.js.
